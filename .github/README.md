# Friendify 

## Overview:
Friendify is a web application aimed to expand the social side of Spotify. Currently, there are no streamlined methods to share and find new music between friends on Spotify.
Our application helps users share music with their friends. They can see their friends listening habits as well as their own. They can get music suggestions directly from our friend queue system, our random queue system, or find new songs from
analyzing any spotify playlist.

Our site is hosted through render and can be accessed via this url: https://friendify-uxfi.onrender.com

Currently only users added to our dashboard are able to login to the site, we have sent a request to Spotify to remove this limitation and are awaiting their response.
